# ByteBox ðŸ“¦


[ByteBox](https://github.com/huruilizhen/bytebox) is a lightweight file storage and retrieval system that makes uploading and downloading files as easy as grabbing takeout from a food locker. No complex user systems, just remember a short Hash prefix to quickly access your files. 

Please note that ByteBox does not offer file management features; its design philosophy focuses on simplifying the file storage and retrieval process to provide the most direct and convenient service possible.

## Why Choose ByteBox?

- **Super Simple** ðŸŒŸ: No complicated user authentication, just upload your files and remember a short Hash prefix.
- **Blazing Fast** âš¡: Upload your files and instantly get a unique Hash prefix for future retrieval.
- **Secure Storage** ðŸ”’: All files are securely stored on your local server, accessible only with the known Hash prefix.

## User Guide

### File Upload

1. Navigate to the `/upload` page.
2. Select the file you want to upload.
3. Click the "Upload" button, and you'll receive a unique Hash prefix.
4. Remember this prefix (or jot it down), as you'll need it to retrieve your file later.

### File Download

1. Go to the `/download` page.
2. Enter your full Hash value in the provided field.
3. Click the "Download" button, and if your Hash value is correct, your file will start downloading automatically.
4. If the Hash value is incorrect or no matching file is found, we'll provide a friendly message prompting you to check the Hash value again.

## Future Plans

ByteBox is currently under active development! We plan to release executable files for various platforms soon, making it even easier for you to use. Upcoming features include:

- More detailed error messages.
